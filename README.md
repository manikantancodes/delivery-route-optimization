# **Delivery Route Optimization Tool**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to optimize delivery routes for logistics companies, reducing costs and improving delivery times by solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The tool calculates the shortest route that visits all delivery locations once and returns to the starting point, minimizing both distance and delivery time. The project leverages Python-based libraries like `SciPy`, `NetworkX`, and `Matplotlib`, making it adaptable to real-world delivery problems.

### **Key Features:**
- **Distance Matrix Calculation**: Computes distances between delivery locations using geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude).
- **Route Optimization**: Solves the TSP using brute-force or advanced algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery route.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays optimized routes using graphs that show the order of locations and distances traveled.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily integrates with real-world delivery datasets or simulated data to accommodate varying business needs (e.g., multiple vehicle types, varying delivery deadlines, etc.).

- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations
  - `scipy`: Distance matrix and spatial calculations
  - `networkx`: Graph-based visualization of delivery routes

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
Before running the project, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/delivery-route-optimization.git
cd delivery-route-optimization
```

### **Step 2: Install Required Libraries**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Data Preparation**
Ensure you have the delivery data in the `data/delivery_data.csv` file. You can use a real-world dataset or the simulated dataset provided in the `data/` folder.

Sample CSV file structure:
```csv
Location,Coordinates,Order_ID,Vehicle_Type,Vehicle_Capacity (kg),Delivery_Deadline,Delivery_Status
Location_A,"(12.9715987, 77.5945627)",001,Truck,1000,12:30 PM,Delivered
Location_B,"(12.2958104, 76.6393805)",002,Van,500,1:00 PM,Pending
Location_C,"(12.9141417, 74.8559568)",003,Bike,50,11:45 AM,Delivered
Location_D,"(15.3172775, 75.7138884)",004,Truck,800,2:00 PM,Pending
Location_E,"(13.0826802, 80.2707184)",005,Van,600,1:30 PM,Delivered
```

### **Step 4: Run the Optimization Tool**
Navigate to the `src/` directory and run the `main.py` script:
```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

## **How It Works**

1. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - The tool reads the delivery locations from the `delivery_data.csv` file and uses geographical coordinates to calculate the distance between each pair of locations using the **Haversine formula** (via `SciPy`).
   
2. **Route Optimization**: 
   - Using the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** approach, the tool evaluates different permutations of delivery routes and finds the one with the shortest total distance.

3. **Visualization**: 
   - The optimized route is displayed in a graph using **NetworkX** and **Matplotlib**. Each node represents a delivery location, and edges are annotated with the distance between consecutive locations.

## **Example Output**

### **Optimized Route**:
```
Optimal Route: [Location_A, Location_C, Location_D, Location_E, Location_B, Location_F, Location_A]
Total Distance: 540.25 km
```

### **Visualized Route**:

The tool generates a graphical representation of the optimized route, where nodes are delivery locations, and edges represent distances between locations.

## **Data Insights (Optional Power BI Integration)**

For users who wish to explore more detailed delivery performance insights, the tool can be integrated with **Power BI** for visualizing:
- Delivery time efficiency
- Cost reduction due to optimized routes
- Order fulfillment rates
- Vehicle capacity utilization
- Delivery deadlines and status tracking

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implement more efficient TSP solvers (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization) to handle larger datasets.
- **Multiple Vehicles**: Extend the solution to handle multiple delivery vehicles and optimize route distribution.
- **Real-Time Data**: Integrate real-time traffic data to optimize delivery routes dynamically.
- **Dynamic Constraints**: Incorporate additional business constraints like delivery deadlines, vehicle capacity, and driver availability.
